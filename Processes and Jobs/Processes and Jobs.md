# 9th Module-Processes and Jobs
## Listiing Processes
In this challenge the goal was to find a randomized, non-listable /challenge by inspecting running processes so I could run it and get the flag. I ran ps -ef, found the process /challenge/7479-run-11062, executed /challenge/7479-run-11062, and the program printed the flag on the final line.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8ZBaDKbOTC6JFYtG11nxz7CvsgO.QX4MDO0wSM2EzNzEzW}`

**commands used**
```
ps -ef
/challenge/7479-run-11062
```
