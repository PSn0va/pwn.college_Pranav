# 6th Module - Practicing Piping
## Redirceting Output 
In this challenge the goal was to use shell output redirection to create a file containing a secret. I ran echo PWN > COLLEGE to write PWN into the file COLLEGE, then used cat COLLEGE to verify the contents were PWN, which produced the flag.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{EqRh01KG_dzjcHXC1DuOIbNU02V.QX0YTN0wSM2EzNzEzW}`

**commands used**
```
echo PWN > COLLEGE
```
